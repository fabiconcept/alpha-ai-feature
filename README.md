# AI Skin Analysis Next.js App

Welcome to the AI Skin Analysis Next.js app! This repository contains a practice build of an existing feature inspired by Perfectcorp.com. The main objective of this project is to create an AI-powered skin analysis tool using Next.js and face-api.js. The app takes input in the form of a still photo or video of the client's face and provides detailed observations about their skin condition along with personalized skincare recommendations.

## Introduction

In a world increasingly influenced by technology, skin care is also benefiting from the power of artificial intelligence. This project aims to replicate the AI skin analysis feature from Perfectcorp.com using Next.js and face-api.js. By utilizing the face-api.js library, the application will be capable of identifying various skin conditions and providing tailored recommendations for an effective skincare routine.

## Features

- **AI Skin Analysis:** Upload a still photo or video of your face to receive a comprehensive skin analysis report. The AI algorithm powered by face-api.js will identify characteristics such as wrinkles, blemishes, uneven skin tone, and more.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, the application will generate personalized skincare recommendations. These recommendations might include product suggestions, routine adjustments, and general tips for maintaining healthy skin.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless experience for users of all technical levels.

- **Multi-Platform Support:** The application can be accessed from various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, providing flexibility and convenience to users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js (12.0 or higher)
- npm package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fabiconcept/alpha-ai-feature.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alpha-ai-feature`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
